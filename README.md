# Base Android App in Kotlin with Model-View-Presenter (MVP)

This repo contains a base architecture sample of an Android App written with Kotlin, it was made only for training purpose. It's is based on some other repos, mostly from [Karumi](https://github.com/Karumi)

## What I Used

* [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/)
* [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) - For made an request example under a small repository pattern implementation
* [Shot](https://github.com/Karumi/Shot) - In order to implement some Screenshot Test
* [Either](https://github.com/MarioAriasC/funKTionale/tree/master/funktionale-either)
* [Async/Await](https://github.com/metalabdesign/AsyncAwait) - Kotlin library for Android to write asynchronues code, built upon Kotlin coroutines
